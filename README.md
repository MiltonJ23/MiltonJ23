### Hi there 👋, I'm Zingui Fred Mike

#### Software Engineer | System Architect in the Making | Innovator in AI, Blockchain & Distributed Systems

I'm Zingui Fred Mike—a passionate technologist and builder with a robust foundation in Computer Science from the ICT University Cameroon. My journey is defined by a relentless drive to bridge cutting-edge theory and real-world impact, from cryptography and data science to system architecture and cloud-native platforms. I believe in building technology not just for scale, but for positive progress in society.

#### 🌍 What I Do & What Drives Me

- **System Design & Architecture:**  
  I architect and build resilient, distributed systems—recently leading the design and development of [Nexus](https://github.com/MiltonJ23/Nexus), a distributed cloud-native container orchestrator, and [Lendema](#), a secure blockchain-powered donation platform.
- **Research & Applied AI:**  
  My commitment to responsible AI shines in projects like *LinguoMT*, leveraging NLP for underrepresented African languages and exploring the ethics of AI in security and society.
- **Application & Infrastructure Hacking:**  
  From building digital forensics tools for storage analysis to engineering mini-compilers for Cameroonian informal languages, I pursue deep understanding by working at infrastructure and application layers.
